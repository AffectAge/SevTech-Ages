Open the Advancements Window to find out how to progress (Default key "L")

WAILA and a Map are not available from the beginning of the modpack, they need to be unlocked. There are many blocks that are hidden until unlocked through progression!

**Be aware, if you change a resource pack while the pack is running you will need to fully restart the game due to an issue with items not hiding correctly and recipes not showing. Sorry for the inconvenience!**

For Multiplayer Team information use the mod "Together Forever" and check the commands beginning with "/tf" using in-game chat.

3.0.6

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed a Better With Mods Turntable crash. This should also allow you to get back into your worlds that were crashing on load
* Added a number of Betweenland blocks to the Geolosys whitelist allowing ores to overwrite those blocks
* Added back the extra Mulberry Structure that was lost in 3.0.5, sorry!

Mod Updates:
* Environmental Tech (1.12.2-2.0.9c)
    * Update to, hopefully, fix a crash experienced by players

* There is a known bug with being kicked back to the title or server screen after loading into your first world and sometimes after gaining/losing advancements/stages. We are looking into it. You should be able to join the world back with no issues after this happens.

* Dimensional Control has updated and added a new default worldgen. Among removing a few extra biomes and moving some biomes to their proper temperature zone, oceans have been further reduced. YOU DO NOT need to start a new world. Existing worlds will keep their generation type and only new worlds will inherit the new changes. This is not really a bug fix or critical change. It is mostly an enhancement meaning you can start a new world if you want.
