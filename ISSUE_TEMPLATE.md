## Instruction on how to do issues like your boy darkosto
 
 ### Issue / bug
 - Explain the issue / bug as understandably as possible.
 - If possible add minecraft, forge, java and modpack version numbers for debugging (mod authors might need these).
 - If the issue/bug is recurring explain how it can be recreated (helps darkosto!).
 - If possible add error/crash log to [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) and link it here (if you dislike pastebin any other similiar site is fine too).
 - If possible add a video/gif of the issue/bug (makes it easier for darkosto to understand you).
